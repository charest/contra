### Comments

A comment is preceded by the `#` character.  Everything after a `#` is
ignored up to the end of the line.  For example,

     # This is a comment
     var i = 1 + 2 # this is also a comment

There are no special multi-line comments.  If you want to comment out an
entire block of code, you must prefix each line with a `#` character.  That is

     # This is a multi-line
     # comment.
     var i = 1 + 2
