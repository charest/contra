Parallel Programming with Contra
================================

The language features you saw in the [basic tutorial](tutorial.md) are available in almost any other programming language.  The real advantage of Contra is how easily you can write programs which execute statements in parallel.  And not only that, but also take advantage of the many different computing platforms like Charm++, CUDA, HPX, Legion, MPI, OpenMP, etc....
